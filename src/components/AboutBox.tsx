        Hello, my name is Jason. I am a Spring 2024 new grad from the University
        of Maryland College Park with a BS in Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy a wide range of hobbies. Doing calisthenics
        & weightlifting, playing tennis & volleyball, and spending time with
        friends & family are some of my favorite past times. I'm always eager to
        take part in competitve and collaborative sports.
      </p>
      These hobbies translate into my coding. I love to learn new technologies
      and work collaboratively alongside like-minded individuals. Creating
      meaningful software and solving complex problems whilst doing so excites
      me and is how I work my best.{" "}
      <p>
        I am open to new opportunities. Feel free to shoot me a message if you
        want to talk. Thanks for checking out my porfolio!
      </p>
